NOTE: book_placeholder.jpg is required

The code references: assets/images/book_placeholder.jpg

This should be a 400x600 pixel gray image with "No Cover" text.

For now, a placeholder SVG file (book_placeholder.svg) has been created.

To create the JPG file:
1. Create a 400x600 gray image
2. Add "No Cover" text in the center
3. Save as book_placeholder.jpg in this directory

Or convert the SVG to JPG using an image converter.
